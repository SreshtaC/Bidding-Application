### 5. **Technical Architecture**

#### Front-End
- **Framework**: React
- **Features**: Responsive design, form validation, user-friendly interface

#### Back-End
- **Framework**: Node.js with Express
- **Features**: RESTful API, user registration and login, auction item management, bidding functionality

#### Database
- **Type**: NoSQL (MongoDB)

1. User places a bid on an auction item.
2. Server verifies the bid and updates the auction item's current bid.
3. Server returns the updated bid history to the user.

### 7. **Conclusion**

This high-level design document outlines the architecture and functionality of a full-stack web application for an online bidding system. The application is designed to be user-friendly, secure, and scalable, providing a seamless experience for users to participate in online auctions.
